Convert an image to grayscale.

The code is written for a mini-project of ITCS 5145 Parallel Programming at UNCC.(Q.C.)

To compile the code, we use
        gcc -g -Wall -o color2gray stb_image/stb_image.h stb_image/stb_image_write.h color2gray.c -lm

To run the code, type
        ./color2gray ${input color image} ${output grayscale image} ${image type}

        The format of images depends on its types.
        To specify image type, we have ${image type} as follows:
            1 is for .png file
            2 is for .jpg file
        
        For example,
        ./color2gray lena1.png lena2.png 1
        ./color2gray lizard1.jpg lizard2.jpg 2
